      <p> My name is Brandon Gorson. I'm a novice programmer that is just beginning
        their journey into the wonderful world of web development. I've spent the majority of my
      career as a mental health counselor for youth in Chicago.
    <br>I have a wide range of hobbies involving learning violin, competitive video gaming, running, swimming, cooking and traveling! 
  <br>I'll be using this space to update projects as they are developed. </p>
